# The beginning

- I have been playing with the concept of data science, business analytics a lot lately, figuring out whether this is truly the way I am heading for. I have enjoyed and loved stuffs that involved logistics and I seem to be quite able handling those related tasks as well. However, I discovered that the data analysis part is my favorite part. However, with all the technical concepts and buzzwords floating around the internet, I am having a serious headache right now. Where to begin? This is the BIG question I am currently having. Man, this is so confusing. 
- So when there is a problem, there must be a solution; this is the part where this book comes in: I want to know what can I really do with the data analysis and this book, to be honest, seems to be an easy read. So there it is, my motivation for the book. I hope I will learn something truly useful admidst the sea of the internet.
- Data  Science is the transformation of data using maths and statistics into valuable insights, decisions and products
- A book about techniques instead of tools
